## What is **Fallout: FISSION**

**Fallout: FISSION** is a modern, streamlined evolution of the Fallout 2 engine — built on the foundation of **Fallout2-CE**, and guided by a clear, deliberate philosophy: **simplify, clarify, and preserve the original spirit of Fallout**, while enabling the **expansion, modification, and improvement of the Fallout world itself**.

Where projects like *sfall* extend Fallout by enabling powerful gameplay modifications, experimental mechanics, and mod-specific opcode support, **FISSION** follows a different path: it **extends, refines, and integrates core engine features to support modular content and narrative extendibility**. The result is an engine that preserves Fallout’s core gameplay while providing a stable, maintainable foundation for expanding its world over time.

---

### **FISSION’s Core Goals**

- **Simplify configuration**  
  No more juggling multiple INI files like `ddraw.ini` or `f2_res.ini`. All engine and graphics settings are accessible directly inside the game through an integrated preferences interface, or via the original 'fallout2.cfg'.

- **Maintain compatibility**  
  Existing scripts, mods, and art assets built for vanilla Fallout 2 (and CE) still work. The vanilla game, or TCs that worked with the original .exe, work with FISSION.

- **Modernize the experience**  
  True widescreen support, scalable interfaces, and consistent behavior across platforms — macOS, Windows, Linux, and more. Limited improvements to modernize the experience, without undoing the original.

- **Preserve authenticity**  
  Every design choice respects the pacing, tone, and intent of the original Fallout titles. The focus is on preserving what made the games iconic, not rewriting them.

- **Encourage accessibility and modding**  
  A cleaner, easier setup means players and fans can setup, understand, and modify the engine without digging through layers of undocumented hacks, or overlapping extensions.

---

## Why FISSION?

**Fallout: FISSION** isn’t just another compatibility fork — it’s a statement on how classic games should be preserved.

Instead of endlessly stacking patches and workarounds, FISSION rebuilds the Fallout 2 experience with **structure, extendibility, and respect for its roots**. The engine aims to extend the *world* of Fallout — not rewrite the *gameplay* itself.

- **For players**: a faster, cleaner, and more reliable way to experience Fallout.  
- **For modders**: new possibilities beyond monolithic total conversions and fragile repacks.  
- **For developers**: a stable, maintainable foundation that honors the past without being chained to it.
