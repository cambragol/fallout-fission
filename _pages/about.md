## About **Fallout: FISSION**

**Fallout: FISSION** is a modern, streamlined evolution of the Fallout 2 engine — born from the foundation of **Fallout2-CE**, but designed with a clear philosophy: to simplify, clarify, and restore the original spirit of Fallout.

Where *sfall* expanded the classic engine through countless add-ons, experimental tweaks, and mod-specific opcode patches, **FISSION** takes the opposite approach. It consolidates, refines, and integrates — keeping what truly enhances Fallout, and leaving behind the patchwork complexity that accumulated over decades of external modifications.

---

### **FISSION’s Core Goals**

- **Simplify configuration**  
  No more juggling multiple INI files like `ddraw.ini` or `f2_res.ini`. All engine and graphics settings are accessible directly inside the game through an integrated preferences interface, or via the original 'fallout2.cfg'.

- **Maintain compatibility**  
  Existing scripts, mods, and art assets built for vanilla Fallout 2 (and CE) still work. The vanilla game, or TCs that worked with the original .exe, work with FISSION.

- **Modernize the experience**  
  True widescreen support, scalable interfaces, and consistent behavior across platforms — macOS, Windows, Linux, and more. Limited improvements to modernize the experience, without undoing the original.

- **Preserve authenticity**  
  Every design choice respects the pacing, tone, and intent of the original Fallout titles. The focus is on preserving what made the games iconic, not rewriting them.

- **Encourage accessibility and modding**  
  A cleaner, easier setup means players and fans can setup, understand, and modify the engine without digging through layers of undocumented hacks, or overlapping extensions.

---

### **Why FISSION Matters**

**Fallout: FISSION** isn’t just another compatibility branch — it’s a statement about how to preserve classic games responsibly. Instead of endlessly stacking patches and workarounds, FISSION rebuilds the Fallout 2 experience with deliberate structure, transparency, and respect for its roots. The engine seeks to extend the *world* of Fallout, not *rewrite* the gamplay itself.

- For **players**, that means an easier, faster, and more reliable way to enjoy the Fallout world.
- For **modders**, its opens up a new type of modding, that no longer requires monolithic total conversions or painstackingly combined repacks.
- For **developers**, it’s a stable foundation to build upon — one that honors the past, but isn’t chained to it.

## **Fallout: FISSION — clean code, clear purpose, classic Fallout.**
